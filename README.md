Hey, I'm software engineer at Salesforce and have 4 years of work experience building software. 

I have worked extensively on cloud computing technologies (specialize in AWS) and backend development( specialize in Rest APIs with J2EE). I have architected the system design as well as deployment infrastructure for 10 micro services using AWS EKS (Kubernetes). Throughout my previous employments I have been a part of 14 successful production releases, being responsible for devising production rollout strategies for 4 of them.

I'm skilled in Core Java, Python, Multi-threading, Hibernate, J2EE, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes and different Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB). 

I love innovating new methods, algorithms and techniques to solve challenging problems. While working for my previous employer, Avaya, I participated in every company-hosted Hackathon and won the 2019 iteration. Additionally, I filed a Patent with Avaya based on a novel method to route incoming calls based on emotions.
