Hey, I'm an MSCS student at Stony Brook University and have 3 years of work experience building software. 

I'm skilled in Core Java, Multi-threading, Collections, Hibernate, J2EE, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes and different Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB). 

I love innovating new methods, algorithms and techniques to solve challenging problems. While working for my previous employer, Avaya, I participated in every company-hosted Hackathon and won the 2019 iteration. Additionally, I filed a Patent with Avaya based on a novel method to route incoming calls based on emotions.

While developing the software, I emphasize on System Design, Development, Implementation, Clean and Well Tested Code.

I hold B.Tech in Computer Science from College of Engineering, Pune. 
I have been a quick learner and a team player. I like to solve complex problems and work in a challenging, fast-paced, and competitive environment that is beneficial for my employer and me.
